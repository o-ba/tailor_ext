Example TYPO3 extension using [tailor](https://github.com/TYPO3/tailor)
cli tool for publishing to [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/).

## What's this all about?

This extension is used to simulate common TYPO3 extensions. The
main focus is on Github workflows for executing tests using
the [TYPO3 testing framework](https://github.com/TYPO3/testing-framework)
and for publishing tagged versions to [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/)
using the [tailor](https://github.com/TYPO3/tailor) cli tool.

Head over to the [actions](https://github.com/o-ba/tailor_ext/actions)
tab to get more information about the executed workflows.

It also includes examples how to setup a valid `ext_emconf`
file, how to define a `composer.json` to be used in the
GitHub workflows and how to start a documentation.

## Important

This extension will change over time as it's also used
as test extension for further development of
[tailor](https://github.com/TYPO3/tailor).
